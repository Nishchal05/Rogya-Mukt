        <p><h2>Exercise is a great way to improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression.Here are some exercises that can help:</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list1">Ginger</li>
            <p><h3>A common and popular treatment for malaria is the use of ginger; fortunately, ginger is easy to access and can be boiled down into a powerful decoction that will boost your immune system and help speed up the recovery process after an infection. Ginger’s active ingredient gingerol, and its unique hydrocarbons are known for their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in the body, making it one of the most effective natural remedies.</h3></p>
            <li class="list1">Grapefruit</li>
            <p><h3>There is a powerful substance found in grapefruit, similar to quinine, which has been directly linked to neutralizing malaria-inducing parasites. You can extract this substance for a concentrated dose or simply add some delicious grapefruit to your diet. Grapefruits are widely available in tropical areas and can do wonders in promoting overall health and rapid recovery.</h3></p>
            <li class="list1">Citrus Fruits</li>
            <p><h3>Although this is a rather vague suggestion, citrus fruits, in general, are often recommended for the treatment of malaria. Limes and lemons are easy to get a hold of in many malaria-prone regions, and the antioxidant compounds, vitamins, and minerals present in them can help eliminate fever, prevent the spread of the infection, and speed up the healing process. Mixing a few drops of lime and an entirely squeezed lemon into a glass of water is a popular approach. Even better, just take a bite of those healthy fruits to get the goodness of fiber.</h3></p>
            <li class="list1">Holy Basil</li>
            <p><h3>o reduce the symptoms and severity of malaria, people have turned to holy basil for many years; eugenol is its active ingredient, and is largely responsible for its therapeutic properties, helping to eliminate bacterial infections. Different parts of this plant are used for dozens of Ayurvedic remedies, making it extremely important in Asian countries that deal with many cases of malaria.</h3></p>
            <li class="list1">Orange Juice</li>
            <p><h3>Vitamin C is known as an incredible immune system booster and this has certainly proven true in the treatment of malaria. Since it can be difficult to keep away from food while suffering from malaria, many people choose to go on a water and orange juice diet, to keep the body hydrated and promote a concentrated attack on the infection. The antioxidant and immune-system boosting effects of vitamin C are often enough to kick-start the recovery process.</h3></p>
